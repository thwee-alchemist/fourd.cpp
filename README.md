SEIZURE WARNING: When run, this code may induce seizures.

You have been warned.

fourd.cpp is a dynamic multilevel graph visualization written in C++, compiled to fourd.wasm, and included via fourd.js in fourd.html.

Running this example might require a setup of emsdk. Look up your operating system dependent installation instructions.

To see the graph in action, navigate [here](https://thwee-alchemist.github.io/fourd.cpp) and set the repulsion to something low, like .4, watching the console as you adjust values. 

Then slowly add vertices, not too many at once. 

Edges currently don't work so well, that is, you can't add more than one, a rather serious limitation. 

That's what I'm currently working on.
